# Blog-WebDevelopment
I present my new Web Development project - an elegant blog - 'Architopia' focused on Architecture. 
The blog contains- Home, About Me and Contact page with a minimal design and black and white colour palette.
The repository includes an HTML file and a CSS file that combine to create a visually stunning and functional blog. 
Hope you like it!
